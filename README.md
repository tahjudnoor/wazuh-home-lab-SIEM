#Wazuh Home Lab SIEM
This project is a complete Wazuh SIEM Home Lab built to understand how security monitoring, log analysis, and file integrity detection work in real-world environments. The setup includes a Wazuh Manager running on Ubuntu and a Wazuh Agent installed on a Windows machine. The manager collects system logs, processes events, and displays security alerts through the Wazuh Dashboard.

A major part of the project involves enabling File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on Windows. A specific folder is monitored in real time to detect any file creation, modification, or deletion. These events automatically generate alerts in the dashboard, demonstrating how organizations detect unauthorized activity or possible intrusions.

This lab provides hands-on experience with SIEM tools, endpoint monitoring, alert analysis, and basic SOC-level investigation. It is designed to build practical cybersecurity skills by replicating how security analysts track and respond to events inside an enterprise environment.
